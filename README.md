# clear-the-print-queue-if-a-document-is-stuck
This script will help you to erase the files in your printer queue automotically 

In my current job the printer used to get stuck before i start working here, when i was like 14 years old, i found out the way to fix this queue error but it was all manually,
when my coworkers realized that i could fix that, they love me, because when this happened before they had to call support and it took around 2 hours to fix the issue and also
it was expensive, but it was getting really annoying that each time the printer got stuck i had to stop my things, and fix the issue, and it used to happen like 5-6 times
a day.

I am new in the programming world, i have a degree in business so i haven't coded anything before, last year i was bored and i started learning python and realized that
the code is beautiful haha and that i really enjoy this, so this is my first personal project:

Is a simple script that stops the service Spool and while this is stopped, erase the files that are in your printer queue, then when the files are erased, restarts the
service Spool again and the printer is full functional again.

Please if you have any feedback on my script i would be happy to know, i really want get better as a programmer.
